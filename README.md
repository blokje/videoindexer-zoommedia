# Video Indexer + Zoom Media

### Introduction
This PowerShell script will deploy a set of Azure resources that integrate the Microsoft [Video Indexer](https://www.videoindexer.ai/) service with Zoom Media's [speech-to-text](https://www.zoom-media.nl/en/speech-to-text/) service.

It is important to change the videoindexerkey and zoommediatoken variables before running this script, or manually changing these values in the Logic App once it is deployed.
